# Privacy

This folder contains code related to the work on private trajectories.
Feel free to ignore (unless you want to reproduce the results shown in "TODO").

## Usage

The privacy manager operates on privacy environments that provide rewards based on how private trajectories are.
These environments are available [here](https://github.com/sgowal/gym-extras).
